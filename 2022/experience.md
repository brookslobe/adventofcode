# Takeaways from first AoC

## Including 
- AoC process itself
- Python familiarization
- Code modularity/flexibity...hindsight improvements

## Day 01
- Function for reading input would be a good first util
- Boolean values as "True" and "False"..."or"/"and" operators
- Jank off-by-one with pointer
- How to print without newline double-up?
- Regex library instead of comparing against string literals for whitespace
- List indexing is neat

## Day 02
- Better way to deal with loop-around fencepost than ternary with min/max idx?
- Python doesn't have constants...guess I could use UPPER_CASE_VAR still
- Ternaries, yay
- Avoided the temptation to make a 3x3 literal using a 2d list.  That'd probably have been quicker, despite the dirtiness.
