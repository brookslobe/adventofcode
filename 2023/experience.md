# Takeaways from AoC 2023

## Including 
- AoC process itself
- Python familiarization
- Code modularity/flexibity...hindsight improvements

## Day 01
- C# definitely harder than python to do scrappy things with
- "simple main" and top level statements easier for scrappy things
- `dotnet` CLI works well for simple commands like `dotnet run`
- Need a better way to separate files for two halves of the day for clarity afterwards
- C# in vscode without intellisense extension is rough lol
- Intersect() seems like a pretty ineffiecient approach...probably something better

## Day 02
- Downloaded the C# extension for vscode but it doesn't help much?
- Split up Part 1 and Part 2
- Felt very in control and prepared for the remix
- Misinterpreted Part 2 as needing to swap to mins instead of maxes...having to support nullable instead of 0 default for ints took a lot of time until realizing it was unnecessary
